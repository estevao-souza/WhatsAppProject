### About this project
WhatsApp is a “WhatsApp Like” application and was created with the aim of practicing my knowledge in developing a little more complex Android application with Kotlin that uses their own back-end. This application uses the MVVM architecture pattern and implements a messaging system with its own back-end, using Firebase and its tools, such as: 
- Firebase Authentication, for authentication in general of all users.
- Firestore, to save all users data, messages and conversations in a cloud-based NoSQL database.
- Storage, to store all profile photos on your own cloud-based storage.

### Observations
This application is for study purposes only. I tried to apply the core of a messaging app, not all WhatsApp features will be presented.

### Functionalities
- Sign in, sign up and sign out user.
- Update user profile data, such as: User name and profile photo.
- Send and receive messages to any user, starting a new conversation or continuing a previous one.

### Getting Started
To run this application in development mode, you'll need to create an account on Firebase and do all of its configuration steps, as well as Firebase Authentication, Firestore and Storage. After all of these are done, you simply need to paste the "google-services.json" file into the app folder.
