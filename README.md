![Final](https://github.com/estevao-souza/WhatsAppProject/assets/62207482/6d9f280a-0403-44ea-a9d3-986a39afc29c)

### About this project
WhatsApp Clone is a “WhatsApp Like” application and was created with the aim of practicing my knowledge in developing a little more complex Android application with Kotlin that uses their own back-end. This application uses the MVVM architecture pattern and implements a messaging system with its own back-end, using Firebase and its tools, such as: 
- Firebase Authentication, for authentication in general of all users.
- Firestore, to save all users data, messages and conversations in a cloud-based NoSQL database.
- Storage, to store all profile photos on your own cloud-based storage.

### Observations
This application is for study purposes only. It focuses on implementing the core features rather than replicating every functionality of the original app.

### Functionalities
- Sign in, sign up and sign out user.
- Update user profile information: username and profile photo.
- Send and receive messages to any user, starting a new conversation or continuing a previous one.

### Getting Started
To run this application in development mode, you'll need to create an account on Firebase and do all of its configuration steps, as well as Firebase Authentication, Firestore and Storage. After all of these are done, you simply need to paste the "google-services.json" file into the app folder.
